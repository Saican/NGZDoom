NGZDoom
=======

NGZDoom is a fork of GZDoom which aims to add experimental modding features. Maintained by Nash Muhandes.

To use the new ACC features, you muse include the NGZDoom headers: https://github.com/nashmuhandes/NGZDoom-acc

New features:

DECORATE A_SetRoll
DECORATE "roll" variable

ACS SetActorRoll, ChangeActorRoll, GetActorRoll

Prettier documentation will come later when I have time
